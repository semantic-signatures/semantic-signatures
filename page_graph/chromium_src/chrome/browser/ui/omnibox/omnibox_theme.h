// Intention is to add a value to OmniboxTint since we want to support more
// states than Chromium but do not want to override / patch every call
// to GetOmniboxColor.
// We'd rather override LocationBarView::GetTint to return the extra enum value
// and override GetOmniboxColor to support it. So that means allowing the many
// places which pass around the enum value to support our enum values instead.

// define new enum
enum class OmniboxTint { DARK, LIGHT, NATIVE, PRIVATE };
